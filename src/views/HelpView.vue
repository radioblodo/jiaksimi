      <h2>üç≥ Why I Built This</h2>
      <p>
        I often found myself standing in front of my fridge, wondering what I
        could cook with the random ingredients I had. This web app was created
        to solve that problem ‚Äî helping people quickly discover recipe ideas
        based on what they already have at home.

        make the most of their pantry. It's especially designed with Singaporean
        and Malaysian kitchens in mind, featuring local ingredients and flavors.
